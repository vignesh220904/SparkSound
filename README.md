📝 Prototype Summary:  
SparkSounds is a mobile application developed to enhance sound awareness for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Using AI-based real-time sound detection, the app identifies key environmental sounds—like sirens, alarms, temple bells, and public announcements—and alerts users through a combination of visual notifications and vibration feedback. All detection runs locally on the device, ensuring both speed and user privacy.

--------------------------------------------------
✨ Key Features:  
- Offline AI-powered sound classification  
- Visual alerts and customizable vibration feedback  
- Detects emergency, cultural, and ambient public sounds  
- Supports multiple languages with automatic translation  
- Admin panel to broadcast alerts or instructions  
- Configurable sound preferences and vibration intensity  
- Alert history log for user awareness and tracking

🚨 Problem Statement:  
People with hearing disabilities often miss critical environmental sounds, which can put them at risk—especially in public places. Existing solutions are either costly, require constant internet access, or are not user-friendly. SparkSounds offers a free, offline, and accessible solution to bridge this communication and awareness gap.

--------------------------------------------------
💡 Prototype Overview:  
SparkSounds uses the device’s microphone to capture audio and processes it locally using machine learning models. When a recognizable sound is detected, the app instantly provides vibration alerts and on-screen messages. Admin users, such as temple staff or event organizers, can also broadcast announcements that are auto-translated and delivered to users in their preferred language. With its focus on accessibility, simplicity, and scalability, SparkSounds can be adopted in various environments like temples, schools, public events, and emergency zones.
